# System Programming with GOLANG

This will go through the system programming under linux based operating systems in **GO**. This is me mostly trying to get my head around GO and Linux at the same time. This might help you if you are trying to do the same.

## Why not C/C++?

Well I wanna play with GO, it seems fun until now.
